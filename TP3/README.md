## Project information

- Main strong points
  * New primitives for pieces (GamePiece and AuxiliarPiece) and for pass button (PassButton).
  * Animation of pieces in every play (from user or from computer).
  * Pieces change their color when clicked.
  * SpriteText used for game time and scorer (in score board) and for play time (for each player in it's turn, near the pass button).
  * Use of obj models w/ support in XML and Reader (leaf objfile). Obj models w/ textures applied.
  * Use of a variety of textures in both scenes (Room and Garage).
  * Both scenes w/ high visual detail w/o influencing load time too much.
  * Quick scene load time (for both scenes considering it's elements).
  * Organized and simple but efficient user interface (GUI) w/ all necessary options.
  * Swack class responsible for communication with PROLOG and for keep the variables necessary for gameplay and for game validation. 
  * Invalid move or winner of a game shown in an alert popup.
  * Possibility to see a movie of an end game.
  * Structured and organized code w/ all necessary comments.

- Scenes
  * Our Room scene is a room, with...
    - ... a couch and a cat on top of it.
    - ... a board with score and game time.
    - ... two lamps (left and right).
    - ... a table and two chairs. On top of the table, there's the board with all the pieces, a container w/ extra pieces for each player, a pass button for each player and the time of a play for each player too.
    - ... textures applied to both floor and walls.

## Issues/Problems

- The rotation of camera from Player 1 camera to Player 2 camera has a slightly error sometimes. By the end of the rotation, the camera is on the right position, but the movement is sometimes a litte bit strange.
- The moved pieces don't cross each other, but the one that comes from outside the board, sometimes, depending of the size of the game stacks, cross some pieces.
