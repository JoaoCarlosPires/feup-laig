## Project information

- Main strong points
  * All primitives defined (including the Patch, Plane and defbarrel)
  * Keyframe Animation implemented and used both in Flag and Plane movement
  * SpriteText implemented and used in a sentence (with support for A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and some special characters)
  * SpriteAnimation implemented and used for both Pigeons
  * SpriteSheet implemented and used for SpriteText and SpriteAnimation
  * Use of textures in Road (now uses the Plane primitve and not the rectangle as in TP1), the middle building (not anymore a group of primitives; now is a single Patch) and in the Trash Can (new element based on defbarrel primitive)
  * Quick secene load time
  * Structured and organized code w/ all necessary comments
- Scene
  * Our scene is a Times Square replica, with...
    - ... three main buildings (one of them is a Patch; all have textures applied to).
    - ... a street (Plane) divided by a sidewalk with an USA Flag, flowers and a trash can. In the street, there are also two pigeons.
    - ... a plane that moves from right to left and from back to front
    - ... a sentence ("Welcome to Times Square!") that uses SpriteText
