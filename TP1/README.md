## Project information

- Main strong points
  * All primitives defined
    * All with texture coordinates (triangle and rectange with afs/aft)
    * Torus, Cylinder and Sphere with all it's values (stacks, slices, loops, innerRadius and outerRadius, etc.)
  * Parser completed and with error checking, namely:
    * When there's no light defined in XML, the code adds one to be used by default
    * When there's no camera defined in XML, the code adds one to be used by default
    * When textures aren't defined in XML, the file doesn't exist or something else, the code doesn't apply it (ignores and just logs the error)
    * When materials aren't defined in XML or some error occurs, the code applied a default one
    * When a primitive isn't correctly defined or some error occurs, the code ignores and logs the error
  * Added a GUI checkbox to select whether the tiny white cube of a light is displayed or not

- Scene
  * Our scene is a Times Square replica, with...
    - ... three main buildings (all with publicity textures applied to two of their faces and one with an additional texture for the roof).
    - ... a street divided by a sidewalk with an USA flag and some flowers.
